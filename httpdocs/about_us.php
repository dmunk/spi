      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Spirited Packaging, Inc. was founded on the simple principle that every craft wine maker and olive oil producer deserves a superior level of customer service. Spirited Packaging is a 
        family-owned and operated business that shares the same values and passion as our customers. We understand the balance of craftsmanship and good business decisions required to build a 
        successful brand. We view our job as an extension of your business and we'll provide you with only Best-in-Class products and support.</p>
      <p>In our research, we have found that small- and mid-size producers are not receiving the personal and quality service that we believe every customer deserves. At Spirited Packaging, we are 
        devoted to providing all of our customers with our unequaled personal service and delivering quality glass, when it's needed, at an affordable price. No order is too big or too small, and 
        every customer is treated with superior service.</p>
      <p>Spirited Packaging is based in Stockton California, which is centrally located in the heart of northern California's wine and olive oil growing regions. Our 40,000 square foot facility is 
        easily accessible by truck or rail to minimize transportation costs and environmental impact.</p>
      <p>We are proud of our eco-friendly commitment to provide products and services that reduce the environmental impact across the industry and over the entire product life cycle. Whether it's 
        supplying stylish lighter-weight glass options or keeping surplus inventory in the marketplace, our collective decisions will make a difference for the next generation.</p>
